1.Smoots Problem

One of the most-celebrated units of measurement in some circles is the “smoot.” The smoot is
defined as the height of Oliver R. Smoot in October of 1958 when he was a student at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He had a distinguished career after graduation and was
the chair of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for a year. 

Mr. Smoot was 5 feet, 7 inches tall in 1958. He was used to measure the Harvard Bridge in Boston which is 364.4 smoots
+ 1 ear. The Patroon Island Bridge over the Hudson River is 1795 feet. This is 321.5 smoots.

Write a program which will be given the length of a bridge in feet. You are to print the length of
the Bridge in smoots. Round the answer to one decimal digit.

Input
Your program will accept multiple test cases. Each test case will be an integer number of feet on
its own line. The program should terminate when a negative number is read.

Output
For each test case, the number of smoots rounded to one decimal digit on its own line. The
terminating case should not have any output associated with it.
